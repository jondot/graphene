# Graphene

[Graphene](http://jondot.github.com/graphene/) is a realtime dashboard & graphing toolkit based on [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) and [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).  

It was made to offer a very aesthetic realtime dashboard that lives on top of [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) (but could be tailored to any back
end, eventually).  

Combining D3's immense capabilities of managing live data, and Backbone's
ease of development, Graphene provides a solution capable of
displaying thousands upon thousands of datapoints in your dashboard, as well as presenting a very hackable project to build on and customize.

# Getting Started

Currently, Graphene loves Graphite's data model (through its API).  


To start,

    $ git clone git://github.com/jondot/graphene.git
    $ cd graphene


## Running the Example

Use the `/example` dashboard to build on.

You should serve that folder off some kind of a helper webserver. For
Ruby:

    $ gem install serve
    $ serve .

And open up your browser at `http://localhost:4000/example/dashboard.html`. You
should see the dashboard alive, rigged with a demo data provider.

## Setting up a Dev Env

This is a no brainer. You gotta have Ruby though; back to your root
Graphene folder,

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec guard start

This gives you an autogenerated build when you modify stuff in app/css
and app/js. Take note that `dashboard.html` points to the `build` folder
where your assets are automatically built to.




## Building a Dashboard

You are probably wondering how do you disconnect the demo data provider
and plug the Graphite data source. Don't worry - more about it
after this.  


As of now, you can place 3 types of data-enabled widgets on your
dashboard: `TimeSeries`, `GaugeLabel`, and a `GaugeGadget`  
You can have as many of these as you want, and you can also hook up
several widgets to the same data source.


To build a new dashboard, you can/should use the builder:

```javascript
var g = new Graphene;
g.demo(); // hook up demo provider, override all urls.
g.build(description);
```


Where `description` will be the hardest thing you'll have to do here. It is a hash structure, note that urls (since we use demo provider) do nothing. Here:

```javascript
description = {
  "Total Notifications": {
    source: "http://localhost:4567/",
    GaugeLabel: {
      parent: "#hero-one",
      title: "Notifications Served",
      type: "max"
    }
  },
  "Poll Time": {
    source: "http://localhost:4567/",
    GaugeGadget: {
      parent: "#hero-one",
      title: "P1"
    }
  },
  "<just an informative label>": {
    source: "<graphite graph url, add &format=json to querystring>",
    "<widget type>": {
      parent: "<which will be placed in this element>",
      title: "<title>"
      // ... many other view opts ...
    }
  }
}
```


That's it basically. Advise the example for how your page should be
structured.


## Using Real Data

Lets see how to hook up a Graphite data source. You should first have an
idea of how your dashboard looks like in "standard" graphite dashboard.  

This means you can go ahead and build (or use) your dash with the
"standard" dashboard tool that Graphite provides.  

## Cross-Domain
In any case, if you don't have your dashboard on the Graphite domain,
you might have a cross-domain issue. In this case please set up your Chrome browser with `google-chrome --disable-web-security`.

## Graphite Data API
Then, given that you saved your Graphite dashboard named `resources`,
fetch this URL:

    http://<graphite>/dashboard/load/resources

You should see a JSON structure which contain these:


    /render?from=-2hours&until=now&width=400&height=250&target=some.metric&title=my_metric

Use that query. Append `&format=json` to it and you've got a
Graphene-ready URL!


    http://<graphite>/render?from=-2hours&until=now&width=400&height=250&target=some.metric&title=my_metric&format=json



# Autodiscovery

If all you really want is to migrate your Graphite "old" dash, a good
starting point would be with `discover()`, which will take all of your
timeseries and convert to a dashboard running Graphene TimeSeries:

```javascript
var g = new Graphene;
g.discover('http://my.graphite.host.com', 'dev-pollers', function(i, url){ return "#dashboard"; }, function(description){
  g.build(description);
  console.log(description);
});
```

You should specify `graphite host`, `dashboard name`, a `parent
specifier` which is responsible to spit out the next graph parent, and a
`result callback`.

You can also use the `description` result as a starting point for
building a more elaborate dashboard.

Check out an example at `/examples/dashboard-autodiscover.html`


# I Want More!

Since Graphene is really a Backbone application (View, and Model, no
Controller here), you should be aware that your data is fetched to a
Model, munged on, and 'broadcasted' to interested parties (such as widgets).  

This means you can take a look at the Model, and be able to configure it
to your own needs. One example is specifying a `refresh_interval`.   

It wouldn't make sense to poll on your Graphite backend frequently, if the
data is updated slowly; turn `refresh_interval` up a notch.

## Extra View options
You can drop any of the below options in the builder's dashboard
description.


### GaugeLabel

* `unit` - unit to display, example "km", or "req/s"
* `title` - the gauge title
* `type` - how should data get aggregated?
  * `max` picks the largest value in the set of datapoints,
  * `min` picks the smallest value in the set of datapoints,
  * `current` picks the newest value in the set of datapoints,
  * null or no setting picks the first value in the set.
* `value_format` - you can specify a value formatter (see d3)



### GaugeGadget

* `title` - again, gauge title
* `type` - same as GaugeLabel
* `value_format` - value format
* `from` - start value of the gauge
* `to` - end value of the gauge


### TimeSeries

* `line_height` - visuals, default 16
* `animate_ms` - new data animation in
* `num_labels` - max labels to display at the bottom
* `sort_labels` - order labels will be sorted
* `display_verticals` - display vertical ticks (eww!)
* `width` - box width
* `height` - box height
* `padding` - the kind of padding you need
* `title` - box title
* `label_formatter` - and a formatter, as before.
* `yMax` - the max value for the Y axis. If not specified and the URL has a yMax parameter, the value will be taken from the URL. Otherwise, this option will have precedence.
* `ymin` - the min value for the Y axis. 


# Visuals

Good news, other than problems with managing TONS of data points, I avoided using common graphing libraries because it's kinda hard to fit to how they see the world in terms of styling.  

Here you'll be able to just style with CSS. Most graph elements are SVG,
and you already have a good example of a high-contrast styling that I
use.  

Futher SVG is vector graphics. Try stretching up your dashboard, and
you'll find the quality of render isn't affected.

Applying just common CSS rules should give you everything that you need.

## Colors
A good thing to think about is colors in your graph. In a time series,
you'd want each graph to appear distinct from the other, but still keep
a general notion of style (relate to the previous one).  
To do that, I've generated colors based on HSL, taking the next color on
the wheel serially, and keeping a good distance for a good contrast.  
For more detail, see `/tools`


# Roadmap

These significant features will happen in the following weeks:

* Visual hints. Lower/upper threshold options for TimeSeries. Once a
  value passes above/below these, the Graph will give a visual cue
(flashing, heartbeat)
* RSS widget. Include a stream of events using an RSS feed; provide
  regex rules which cause RSS entries to be included, or be classified
as various levels of alerts. The goal is to be able to incorporate
 source control history (GitHub events), and alert feeds from other systems.
